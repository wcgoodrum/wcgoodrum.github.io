personal hub of my socials, exercise in web design

panels to design:
- spotify
- strava
- letterboxd
- goodreads
- steam
- vsco
- nytimes wordle and mini

the general idea is to do this using async webscrape requests to build out the windows myself instead of using the iframes like i have now.
this way i can practice and show off my css skills
it would be cool to implement a cache for this stuff so that it doesn't directly request everytime i load the page, so i need to research that.
having my nytimes (wordle and mini) will require me to build out a seperate tool entirely to track that stuff.
